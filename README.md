# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the result of my Tweeter project. The SPA Twitter clone was built with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX for the front-end user experience , and with Node, Express and MongoDB for the back-end server. This was made for a simplistic and intuitive user experience.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository, then clone your fork of this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.
5. Tweet away to your heart's content, however be aware that the tweets will actually be persistent thanks to MongoDB.
